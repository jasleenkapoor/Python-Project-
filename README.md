Python-Project- is a package coded in Python to solve the Schrodinger equation at different potentials.

It is able to solve the time-dependant Schrodinger equation in a square well or a simple harmonic oscillator.
Motivation behind this project is to allow user with no knowledge to solve and play around with the TDSE and see how it changes with different parameters.

The software package should be installed in order it to run.
when the software is run, pop up questions appear allowing the user to set its own parameters.

**Description on how to install software**
The software to install can be found in setup.cfg. 

NOTE: INFORMATION IN NOTEBOOK NO LONGER WORKS DUE TO UPDATE IN PIP. FOLLOWING METHOD BELOW WORKS.

1. pip install --user . #This provides the path as to where 'python' is being accessed from [seen in yellow text]

2. python C:\Users\zhap066\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python38\Scripts\add_one.exe #This will error as a number is required next line will show argument example

3. python C:\Users\zhap066\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python38\Scripts\add_one.exe 2 #This can be any number, here I chose two. This will return 3

4. add_one(2) #This will return the same as line 3, but from this point on in the code add_one() can be used as a shorthand. Must do the beginning section in order to use the function throughout.
